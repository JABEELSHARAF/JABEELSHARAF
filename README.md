# About Me

Hello, I'm Denver-Dude, and I'm a passionate programmer who started his coding journey in 2019. Since then, I've been on an exciting and ever-evolving path, exploring various programming languages and creating meaningful projects that have made a positive impact.

## My Journey

- I began my coding adventure with HTML, laying the foundation for web development at 2019.
- Soon after, I delved into Python, where I discovered the world of versatile scripting, data analysis, and automation.
- Exploring R, I gained insights into statistical computing and data visualization.
- My journey continued with languages like C, broadening my understanding of low-level programming and algorithms.

## My Projects

Throughout my coding journey, I've had the privilege of working on numerous projects that have not only honed my skills but have also been used by people and organizations. Some of these projects include:

- [Subject Browser](https://denver-gvis.github.io/Subject-Browser/): Help anyone who is new to the internet with searching their queries by removing unwanted wordings to get the best search results

- [Test Gangster](https://den-enterprise.github.io/test-gangster/): Help IGCSE students who are new to the syllabus by providing study materials, online MCQ exams, promoting other platforms which will be greatly helpful

I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to take on new challenges. Feel free to explore my repositories to learn more about the projects I've been involved in.
